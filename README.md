# Roundhouse Kick

Tool to help you suck less at database development.

## Why use Roundhouse Kick

Data teams are not exempt from testing their code.  Roundhouse Kick 
provides a simple way to develop databases using a test-driven approach.

## Why was Roundhouse Kick developed?

As a professional software engineer and consultant I've seen way too 
many data teams and teams that work with databases fail or be 
impeded by the lack of unit testing on database work.  Scowering the 
interwebs I haven't been able to find a simple, comprehensive DB TDD 
solution.  So I took a list of problems I've observed over my career 
and wrote a simple tool to enable such testing.
